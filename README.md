# Ranplugin 1.21
A mutilated plugin i made that has the ugliest code you've ever seen. It has random features I liked in other plugins so instead of creating a new plugin every single time I just put everything in this one plugin.
## ðŸš€ Features

- **/nick:** Allows you to nick yourself. Just yourself.
- **/house** Creates a simple wooden house at the players location, you can choose to add a roof or not. Might add more params for things like size.
- **/sign** Allows you to "sign" an item. Just adds whatever lore you want to the item.
- **/hostevent** Hosts an event for the event system.
- **/joinevent** Joins current hosted event.
- **/sendplayer** Technically already built in velocity, but I wanted to add it so I did.

Just look in the plugin.yml file for usage.
